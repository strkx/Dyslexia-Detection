## Features

ðŸ”¹ Cognitive Tests â€“ Evaluates reading speed, spelling accuracy, phonemic awareness, and response time.

ðŸ”¹ Handwriting Analysis â€“ Uses a CNN-based model to detect dyslexic handwriting patterns with high accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ Eye-Tracking Technology â€“ Analyzes reading patterns, including saccade analysis and blink rate determination.

ðŸ”¹ OCR Tool â€“ Converts book pages into text, applies the OpenDyslexic font for improved readability, and provides a text-to-speech option for accessibility.

ðŸ”¹ Integrated Risk Assessment â€“ Combines multiple evaluation methods for precise dyslexia detection.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/strkx/Dyslexia-Detection.git
    cd Dyslexia-Detection
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `src/main/webapp/my_ocr_app` directory.
3.  Install the necessary Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install flask flask_cors opencv-python pytesseract spellchecker textblob
    ```
    If you intend to use GPU with tensorflow, install tensorflow with GPU support.

## Running the Project

1.  Run the Flask API located in `src/main/webapp/app.py`:
    ```bash
    python src/main/webapp/app.py
    ```
2.  For the OCR functionality, navigate to `src/main/webapp/my_ocr_app` and run `ocr.py`:
    ```bash
    cd src/main/webapp/my_ocr_app
    python ocr.py
    ```
3.  Open the HTML files located in `src/main/webapp/` in your web browser to interact with the web interface. For example, open `index.html` to access the main page.
